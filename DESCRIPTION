Description: Implements bayesian function-on-function regression for multilevel data as described in Meyer et al. (2015). The method involves
    first projecting the functions X and Y onto a wavelet basis and compressing the wavelet coefficients according to the method described in
    Morris et al. (2011). This is followed by (optionally) further reducing the dimension of X by performing PCA and keeping only those principal
    components required to explain a specified proportion of the variation. An MCMC sampler is then used to estimate the beta coefficients. This is
    performed using the WFMM executable file created by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Finally, the beta coefficients are projected
    back to the original data space for interpretation and inferential procedures.
